With delivery and quality in mind. He's mostly using PHP, Python and shell scripting, topped off with some Ansible. From time to time he's acting as resident git manual.

Besides work Ike also spends part of his free time on Open Source development and packaging some applications for [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org). And he's also involved in the organization of the local PHP usergroup [PHP-WVL](http://php-wvl.be).
