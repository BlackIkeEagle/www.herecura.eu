I'm a developer at a e-commerce agency in Belgium, [Studio Emma](https://www.studioemma.com). My main goal is automating tedious repetitive things. Focussed on improving our delivery and quality, leveraging existing or new technology to accomplisch that goal. Developing mostly in PHP, Python and shell scripting to accomplish my goals. Sometimes I also act as resident git manual.

Giving training and doing public speaking brings me pleasure, especially if that triggers a nice discussion where we can leverage each others expertise. I like to think I can help you improve and you can help me improve!

I spend a part of my free time in Open Source development and packaging some great tools for Archlinux. Additionally I'm also involved in the organization of our local PHP usergroup PHP-WVL.

Balancing all of this with family is the greatest challenge. But that is also the most rewarding challenge :).
